# Linux Rs

Most of Linux written in Rust

Linux Rs is an open source Rust kernel based off of [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)

### A few things that need to be said:

Unix was a closed source expensive kernel/OS, [Linux Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds#Early_years) 
created [MINIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix) which was a Mini-Unix, an opensource "knock-off" of Unix. After a 
while MINIX turned into what Linux is now, so that means Linux was intended to be an exact copy of Unix.

What I'm trying to say is, I think it should be ok to make a copy/rewrite of Linux in a different language, so it is 
faster/more secure (because it's Rust).
